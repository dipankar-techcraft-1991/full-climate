I have Completed the assignment (Weather Dashboard).\__
I have given name of the assignment is \*\*_"Full Climate"\_\*\*.

**_"Full Climate"_** project is essentially a web application that provides users with real-time weather data and forecasts which is build in React Js and I have used Tailwind CSS for interactive design. It’s designed to offer a comprehensive view of weather conditions, typically including **(Current Temperature, City of Temperature, Current Wind Speed, Current Humidity and future 6 days Tempareture forecasts)**. Here’s a breakdown of what a weather dashboard project might involve:

**_Data Source:_** The dashboard usually fetches data from a Weather API **_("Visual Crossing Weather" in "Rapid API")_**, which supplies detailed and updated weather information.

**_Functionality:_** It may include features like **_search_** functionality to find current conditions and forecasts for multiple cities.

**_Interactivity:_** Users can interact with the dashboard to check the weather for their **location** or for different **places** they are interested in.
